SELECT ITEMS

Your task is to select items that you would like
to collect as you "run" errands. You can select
items by moving them into the selected area of
the environment.

There is no time limit, so please take your time 
to think about which objects you really want to 
gather later in the experiment.

When you are confident that you have selected the
items that you would like to retrieve, then press
the button to complete the task.

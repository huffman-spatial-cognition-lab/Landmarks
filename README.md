# Landmarks
My fork of mjstarrett/Landmarks for a research project with Prof. Derek Huffman @ Colby College.

# To-do
## Unity -- Experiment Code
- [x] During pointing task, turn off the walls
- [ ] Extend the floor indefinitely

## Bugs
- [ ] Pressing the trigger on the Oculus hand controller during navigation (not supposed to, trigger is for pointing only), the app goes into undefined behavior, where all navigation tasks are immediately skipped, and only relocation and pointing tasks happen
  - [ ] Investigate
